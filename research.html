	<h2>Research</h2>

	<p>
	Born in Quito-Ecuador, I obtained my bachelor degree on Mathematics at
	the Escuela Politécnica Nacional (EPN), in Quito. I moved to Paris in 2013 to enroll the Master's degree program in Applied Mathematics,
	MathBio speciality, at Sorbonne Université (former Pierre & Marie Curie University
	- UPMC).
	</p>
	<p>
	I did my PhD at Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology
	and Public Health (IPLESP - joint unit of research and health of
	Sorbonne Université and Inserm), supervised by Virginie Supervie (Inserm) and
	Romulus Breban (Institut Pasteur). My doctoral research project concerned the
	mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, accounting for voluntary adoption
	of preventive methods, using a game-theoretical approach. Two applications were
	explored: 1. Voluntary vaccination against chilhood infectious diseases (such as measles)
	and 2. Pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake to prevent HIV infection among men
	who have sex with men at high risk of HIV infection. I defended my thesis in July, 2021.
	</p>
	<p>
	I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Modeling, epidemiology
	and monitoring of health risks (MESuRS) lab, at Cnam, from September 2020 to December 2021.
	I worked on mathematical modeling of the nosocomial spreading of COVID-19.
	In particular, the aim was to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among healthcare
	workers participating in the quarantine-hospital intervention established by
	the Egyptian government during the first wave ofthe COVID-19 epidemic.

	<p>
	I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of ecology and environmental
	sciences of Paris (IEES), a joint research unit from CNRS and Sorbonne Univcersité,
	in the Ecology and evolution of interaction networks (EERI) team.
	I will study the dynamics of early epidemics.
