<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
Born in Quito-Ecuador, I obtained my undergraduate degree on Mathematics at
the Escuela Politécnica Nacional (EPN), in Quito. I moved to Paris in 2013
to enroll the Master's degree program in Applied Mathematics,
MathBio speciality, at Sorbonne Université (former Pierre & Marie Curie University
- UPMC).

In September 2015, I started my PhD at Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology
and Public Health (IPLESP - join unit of research and health of
Sorbonne Université and Inserm), supervised by Virginie Supervie (Inserm) and
Romulus Breban (Institut Pasteur). My doctoral research project concerned the
mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, accounting for voluntary adoption
of preventive methods, using a game-theoretical approach. Two applications were
explored: 1. Voluntary vaccination against chilhood infectious diseases (such as measles)
and 2. Pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake to prevent HIV infection among men
who have sex with men at high risk of HIV infection.

I'm currently working on mathematical modeling of the nosocomial spreading of COVID-19
(in particular, in Egyptian quarantine-hospitals) at the Modeling, epidemiology
and monitoring of health risks team of Cnam.
