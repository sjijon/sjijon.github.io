<h1>About me</h1>		
	<p>		
		Born in Quito-Ecuador, I obtained my undergraduate degree on Mathematics at the Science Faculty of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional (EPN), in Quito. In 2013, I enrolled the Master's degree program in Applied Mathematics at Pierre & Marie Curie University (UPMC), in Paris, France; and I chose the MathBio speciality, looking forward to work on mathematical models applied to human health. In September 2015, I enrolled a PhD research project supervised by Virginie Supervie, and Romulus Breban. The aim of our project is to determine if voluntary prevention can prevent an epidemic, using the modeling of infectious diseases transmission and game theory. During my PhD, I also enrolled the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Network coordinated by the School of High Studies in Public Health (EHESP).
