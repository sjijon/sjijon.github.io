		<li>Biomathematics and biostatistics — 2nd year for the Biology undergraduate program</li>
		<br>(TD de LU2V314)
		<br>This course consisted in mathematical and statistical tools essential to the analysis of quantitative experimental data in Biology. The course included a dynamic systems axis (solving systems of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients in 2 dimensions and study of the stationary states of the system) and a statistics axis (normal law, sampling and estimation, test theory and comparison of distributions).
		<li>Mathematics — 1st year of the Science undergraduate program</li>
		<br>(TD de LUMA001 - Groupe BGC 12.6)
		<br>This course consisted in mathematical notions and tools useful in all scientific studies. The first part of the course was devoted to a reception cycle for the recall or acquisition of fundamental notions. Then, the course included notions of functional analysis by studying smooth functions, and notions of algebra by studying linear transformations of the plane.
