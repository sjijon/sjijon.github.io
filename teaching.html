		<li>Biomathematics and biostatistics — 2nd year for the Biology undergraduate program
		<br>(TD de LU2V314)
		<br>This course consisted in mathematical and statistical tools essential to the analysis of quantitative experimental data in Biology. 
			The course included a dynamic systems axis (solving systems of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients in 
			2 dimensions and study of the stationary states of the system) and a statistics axis (normal law, sampling and estimation, 
			test theory and comparison of distributions).
		<br>

		<li>
		Mathematics — 1st year of the Science undergraduate program
		<br>(TD de LUMA001 - Groupe BGC 12.6)
		<br>This course consisted in mathematical notions and tools useful in all scientific studies. The first part of the course was devoted to 
			a cycle to recall or acquire fundamental notions. Then, the course included notions of functional analysis 
			by studying smooth functions, and notions of algebra by studying linear transformations of the plane.
